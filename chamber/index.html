                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Bragg-Creek Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1985 by a group of local business owners
                        who
                        wanted to
                        create a unified voice for the business community. Since then, the Chamber has grown to
                        include
                        over 100
                        members and has become an integral part of the Bragg-Creek community.
